1) Retrieve the total number of orders placed
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM orders;

2) Calculate the total revenue generated from pizza sales
SELECT 
    SUM(price * quantity) AS total_revenue
FROM order_details od
JOIN pizzas p ON od.pizza_id = p.pizza_id
JOIN pizza_types pt ON p.pizza_type_id = pt.pizza_type_id;

3)  Identify the highest-priced pizza.
SELECT pt.name, price 
FROM pizza_types pt
JOIN pizzas p ON pt.pizza_type_id = p.pizza_type_id
ORDER BY price DESC
LIMIT 1;

4)  Identify the most common pizza size ordered.
SELECT p.size, COUNT(*) AS total_orders
FROM order_details od
JOIN pizzas p ON od.pizza_id = p.pizza_id
GROUP BY p.size
ORDER BY total_orders DESC
LIMIT 1;

5) List the top 5 most ordered pizza types along with their quantities.
SELECT pt.name, SUM(od.quantity) AS total_quantity
FROM order_details od
JOIN pizzas p ON od.pizza_id = p.pizza_id
JOIN pizza_types pt ON p.pizza_type_id = pt.pizza_type_id
GROUP BY pt.name
ORDER BY total_quantity DESC
LIMIT 5;

6)  Total quantity of each pizza category ordered
SELECT pt.category, SUM(od.quantity) AS total_quantity
FROM order_details od
JOIN pizzas p ON od.pizza_id = p.pizza_id
JOIN pizza_types pt ON p.pizza_type_id = pt.pizza_type_id
GROUP BY pt.category
ORDER BY total_quantity DESC;

 7) Determine the distribution of orders by hour of the day.
SELECT HOUR(o.time) AS order_hour, COUNT(*) AS total_orders
FROM orders o
GROUP BY order_hour
ORDER BY order_hour;
8) join relevant tables to find the category-wise distribution of pizzas.
SELECT pt.category, COUNT(DISTINCT p.pizza_id) AS total_pizzas
FROM pizzas p
JOIN pizza_types pt ON p.pizza_type_id = pt.pizza_type_id
GROUP BY pt.category
ORDER BY total_pizzas DESC;

9) Group the orders by date and calculate the average number of pizzas ordered per day.
SELECT o.date, SUM(od.quantity) AS total_pizzas
FROM orders o
JOIN order_details od ON o.order_id = od.order_id
GROUP BY o.date;

10) Determine the top 3 most ordered pizza types based on revenue.
SELECT pt.name, ROUND(SUM(price * od.quantity), 2) AS total_revenue
FROM order_details od
JOIN pizzas p ON od.pizza_id = p.pizza_id
JOIN pizza_types pt ON p.pizza_type_id = pt.pizza_type_id
GROUP BY pt.name
ORDER BY total_revenue DESC
LIMIT 3;

solving problems --

-- 01) Retrieve the total number of orders placed.
select count(order_id) as total_orders from orders;

-- 02) Calculate the total revenue generated from pizza sales.
select 
sum(order_details.quantity * pizzas.price) as total_sales
from order_details join pizzas
on pizzas.pizza_id = order_details.pizza_id;

-- 03) Identify the highest-priced pizza.
select 
pizza_types.name, pizzas.price 
from pizza_types join pizzas
on pizza_types.pizza_type_id = pizzas.pizza_type_id
order by pizzas.price desc
limit 1; 

-- 04) Identify the most common pizza size ordered.
select
pizza_types.name, pizzas.size
from pizza_types join pizzas
on pizza_types.pizza_type_id = pizzas.pizza_type_id
order by pizzas.size desc
limit 4;
-- Other way
select 
pizzas.size, count(order_details.order_details_id) as order_count
from pizzas join order_details
on pizzas. pizza_id = order_details.pizza_id
group by pizzas.size
order by order_count desc;

-- 05) List the top 5 most ordered pizza types along with their quantities.
select pizza_types.name, sum(order_details.quantity) as quantity
from pizza_types
join pizzas
on pizza_types.pizza_type_id = pizzas.pizza_type_id
join order_details
on order_details.pizza_id = pizzas.pizza_id
